This is a tool to help you learn the names of things.  It uses google image search API to retrieve images from a user-defined database, displays the image, and quizzes the user as to the identity of the image.  Because google image search API is limited to 100 images per day, this program will stop working after awhile, in which case, you should simply close it and wait a day.  However, there is also a known bug where an image fails to load and so hangs indefinitely (sometimes this is because too few image results were returned).  In this case, it is best to restart the program.


Note that this project is now static.  I don't plan on modifying it further.  The next step is to make an in-browser version running on a web server.
